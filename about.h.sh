about="This script is intended to help automate my Manjaro GNOME post-install routines. Some tasks still require confirmation so please don't leave it executing unattended. Please make sure to examine each script listed in the modules array in the main.h.sh file and their respective header files (*.h.sh) and edit as necessary before executing further, as it may cause unwanted changes. To include/exclude a script, simply edit said modules array. Please do not run this script with sudo as it may lead to unexpected behaviours. A sudoer password will be asked as needed."
